### Passing the Health Check

> **IMPORTANT: ðŸš« Do not modify imported request configurations without explicit instructions.**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. **Import the Collection**: Import the collection `./data/thunder_client/thunder-collection_Testing.json` into Thunder Client.

3. **Start Server**: Use `npm start` to launch the Express server.

4. **Send Request**: Send a request `/health` from the imported Testing collection.

5. **Review Errors**: Carefully examine errors thrown by tests in the `Results` tab in the `RESPONSE` panel of Thunder Client. Modify `./app.js` as needed to pass all tests.

6. **Inspect Scripting**: If necessary, examine the `Test/Scripting` tab in the `REQUEST` panel of Thunder Client for guidance.

7. **Completion**: Once finished, proceed to the next exercise by executing:

```bash
  git checkout exercise2
```
